Features:

- Forward notifications from any app on your device; no more overly-vague "Other" category!
- Search bar to quickly locate apps
- Alphabetical sorting to prevent headaches
- Small size: the APK file is less than two megabytes
- Dark mode (Requires Android 10)

How to use:
1. Select apps to forward notifications from. No need to tap Save as toggling the switches automatically saves them.
2. Enter the IP address and API key for your LaMetric device and tap Save.
3. Make sure you're on the same network as your LaMetric. You should start receiving notifications from the app.
