# Privacy Policy

By using the app you agree to these terms.

### Data the app collects

- LaMetric Notify Plus (LaMetric Notify+) does **not** collect any identifying user data without the user knowing.
- The app generates a list of apps the user has installed on their device.

### Data you provide

- **IP Address**
- **API key**
- **WiFi SSID**

### How this data is used

Data the app collects is not used as it does not exist.

Data you provide is used in the app to

1. Contact the LaMetric Time over the network (IP Adress)
2. Authenticate with the LaMetric Time (API key)
3. Ensure notification signals are only sent when on the correct network (WiFi SSID)

### Where is this data stored?

All data previously mentioned is stored locally using Android "Shared Preferences".

### Where does this data go?

This data stays on the device and only serves to make the app work. It is not sent out by the app through the network or other means.

## Notifications

- The app reads all incoming notifications. Data extracted from notifications includes **title**, **text**, and the **package** of the app sending the notification.
- The app sends this data over the network to a LaMetric Time. It is **not** sent anywhere else and is **not** stored/cached locally.
- The app nor myself (Joshua Moore) are **not** responsible for sensitive data being stolen or obtained during the time that the app forwards a notification to the clock. I am working on getting it to work with local HTTPS but right now the app uses HTTP.

## TLDR

There is no "phone home" or unethical data extraction.
